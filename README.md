# Gentoo Linux

> **A Meta-Distribution Known for Flexibility and Performance**

Gentoo Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that is both flexible and customizable.
It is unique among Linux distributions due to its Portage package management system,
which allows users to compile the source code locally according to their preferences,
often resulting in optimized performance for specific types of computers.

Gentoo is designed to be modular, portable, and easy to maintain,
catering to users who desire a system tailored precisely to their needs and hardware.

Named after the fast-swimming gentoo penguin, the distribution emphasizes the potential for speed improvements
through machine-specific optimization.

Initially created by Daniel Robbins as Enoch Linux,
Gentoo has evolved to support a wide variety of processor architectures and user environments, from desktops to servers.
